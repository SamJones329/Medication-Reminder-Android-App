Due to the large number of illnesses and their respective medications, it can become difficult to organize 
a heap of information such as the dosage required for each, times the dosage must be taken, and even 
keeping track of associated doctor information and appointments can become burdensome.

This prototype medication mobile application is designed to become an extension of a medical patient’s brain—whether 
they are elderly or a child—and structure their medical life. 
The app has three main components:  
* User is able to input and store a list of current medications they are taking (name, required dosage, type of medication, etc.)  
* User can input and store their doctor information (name, type of doctor, phone no, office address, etc.)  
* User will have the option to receive reminders about their current medication and doctor appointment times  
          -They will be able to snooze the reminder and recieve another notification (after a specific time interval)   
          -Alternatively, they can acknowledge that they made the doctor visit/took the medication  

Technologies utilized to create application:  
* Android Studio Software  
* Extensible Markup Language (XML)  
* SQLite (used to store information user provides in tabular format)
